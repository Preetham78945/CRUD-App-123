Run the program 
If you want to get all books then add " /books " to the URL.
If you want to get a book in specific the add " /books " " /1 " to the URL.
To create a book I used postman where I entered the URL and used the command 'post' to enter a new book into the database and you only need to enter the 'title' and 'author' the 'id' will increment itself by 1.
To update a book I just used the 'put' method you have to put the book id in the url and then you will be able to update the book author or title.
To delete a book I used the 'delete' method and then enter the id of the book you want to delete in the URL and it will be deleted.
